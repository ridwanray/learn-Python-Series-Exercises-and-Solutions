# Object-Oriented Programming Practice

## Overview

This practice exercise is designed to test your skills in object-oriented programming with Python. You are required to implement a simple system for managing users, wallets, and transactions. The provided skeleton code serves as a starting point for your implementation.

## Skeleton Code

```python

class User:
    # Your code for the User class here

class Wallet:
    # Your code for the Wallet class here

class Transaction:
    # Your code for the Transaction class here

# Usage:
user1 = User(1, "user1")
user2 = User(2, "user2")

user1.wallet.deposit(100)
user1.wallet.withdraw(30)

user2.wallet.deposit(50)
user2.wallet.withdraw(20)

# Tasks

Complete the Implementation:

Implement the missing parts of the User, Wallet, and Transaction classes based on the provided skeleton code.

Add missing methods:

Add needed methods to the three classes 

Instantiate Users:
-Create instances of two users (user1 and user2) and perform deposit
-withdrawal operations as demonstrated in the example usage.
-Retrieve transactions from the associated wallet.
