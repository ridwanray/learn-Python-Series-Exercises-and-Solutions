## Practice Question 1: CSV File Manipulation

Assume you have a CSV file (sampledata.csv) containing information about students, with columns such as "Name," "Age," and "Score." Write a Python program that reads the CSV file and adds a new column to the CSV file indicating whether each student passed or failed based on their score. The pass score should be taken as 50.


## Practice Question 2: User Input and File Storage

Create a program that takes a series of tasks as input from a user until the user decides to enter 'N', and then saves this information into a file.
